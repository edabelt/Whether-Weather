        Coral reefs are among the most diverse—and most threatened—ecosystems on Earth. Rising sea temperatures, acidification, and more frequent marine heatwaves are driving widespread coral bleaching events. When water warms just 1–2°C above the seasonal maximum, corals expel the algae (zooxanthellae) that live in their tissues, causing the skeleton to show through and the coral to appear “bleached.”

      <h2 class="title is-4 mt-6">Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Over half a billion people depend on coral reefs for food, coastal protection, and income from tourism and fishing. Reefs buffer shorelines from storms, reducing wave energy by up to 97%. Economically, healthy reefs contribute an estimated $36 billion per year in goods and services globally.

      <h2 class="title is-4 mt-6">What’s Driving the Change?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Global warming:</strong> Increased greenhouse gases trap more heat in the atmosphere and oceans.</li>
        <li><strong>Ocean acidification:</strong> CO₂ dissolving into seawater reduces pH, weakening coral skeletons.</li>
        <li><strong>Pollution & runoff:</strong> Sediments and nutrients from land-based sources stress reef communities.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="title is-4 mt-6">Taking Action</h2>
      <p>
        Scientists and conservationists are experimenting with heat-tolerant “super corals,” restoring nurseries, and advocating for marine protected areas. But the most impactful step remains reducing global CO₂ emissions—to keep sea temperatures within the narrow range corals need to survive.
