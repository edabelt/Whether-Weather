      What began as a solitary school strike in Stockholm in 2018 has since ignited a global phenomenon. Millions of students, labor unions, community groups, and faith organizations have paused their routines—walking out of classrooms, halting work at ports, and filling city streets—to demand governments treat the climate crisis with the urgency it deserves.

    <h2 class="title is-3 mt-6">A Movement in Numbers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>March 15, 2019:</strong> Over 1 million participants in 125 countries.</li>
      <li><strong>September 2019:</strong> 7.6 million people in the largest climate march ever recorded.</li>
      <li><strong>Ongoing:</strong> Regular Fridays for Future youth strikes in 2 000+ cities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="title is-3 mt-6">Core Demands</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Declare a climate emergency:</strong> Enact emergency‐level policies aligned with a 1.5 °C target.</li>
      <li><strong>Phase out fossil fuels:</strong> End new coal, oil, and gas projects; redirect subsidies to renewables.</li>
      <li><strong>Ensure a just transition:</strong> Protect workers and frontline communities with retraining and safety nets.</li>
      <li><strong>Deliver climate finance:</strong> Mobilize $100 billion annually for vulnerable countries.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="box mb-5">
      <h3 class="title is-4">London, UK</h3>
      <p>
        On September 20, 2019, 100 000+ people—including teachers, nurses, and students—marched through central London. Parliament declared a climate emergency two weeks later.

    <h2 class="title is-3 mt-6">Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>
      With COP summits on the horizon, organizers are translating street momentum into policy proposals—carbon pricing laws, green infrastructure bonds, and justice frameworks—to ensure protests lead to lasting change.
