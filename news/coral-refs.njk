      Coral reefs harbor more species per square meter than any other marine environment, yet they are among the first ecosystems to suffer under climate change. As sea temperatures climb, these delicate animals expel their symbiotic algae, turning white in a process known as bleaching—and if prolonged, leading to mass die-offs.
    </p>

    <h2 class="title is-3 mt-6">The Science Behind Bleaching</h2>
    <p>
      Corals rely on microscopic algae (zooxanthellae) for up to 90% of their energy. When waters warm just 1–2°C above seasonal peaks, this partnership breaks down:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Oxidative stress:</strong> Heat damages algal photosystems, producing toxic oxygen radicals.</li>
      <li><strong>Algae expulsion:</strong> Corals eject the stressed algae to protect themselves, losing their primary food source.</li>
      <li><strong>Mortality risk:</strong> Without photosynthesis-derived nutrients, corals starve if bleaching persists for more than a few weeks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="title is-3 special">Climate Change Threats to Coral Reefs</h2>
    <p>
      Today, over 60% of the world’s reefs have experienced bleaching, and annual mass-bleaching events are now the norm. These ecosystems:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Protect coastlines by buffering waves—avoiding an estimated $94 billion in storm damage each year.</li>
      <li>Support fisheries that feed over 1 billion people.</li>
      <li>Generate $36 billion annually in tourism.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="title is-3 special">Saving Our Reefs: Efforts Underway</h2>
    <p>
      Scientists and communities are racing to save reefs:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Assisted evolution:</strong> Breeding heat-tolerant coral strains and outplanting them on vulnerable reefs.</li>
      <li><strong>Local protections:</strong> Marine protected areas to reduce pollution, overfishing, and physical damage.</li>
      <li><strong>Global emissions cuts:</strong> Limiting warming to 1.5 °C to give reefs a chance to recover.</li>
    </ol>
